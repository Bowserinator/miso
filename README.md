## How to contribute:

Check the wiki: https://github.com/weeb-poly/miso/wiki#how-to-contribute 

## Requirements:

```bash
npm install
# or "yarn install"
```

## How to run

- Make sure you have the right npm libraries, at the moment, they are https, fs, and puppeteer. Afterwards, run `node <file name>` to test it out. At the moment, this should be enough, as the CLI isnt complete yet, and this should be sufficient for testing files.
