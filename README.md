# Miso
Miso is a project for archiving graphic novels, particularly manga pages from sites. Used in other weeb poly projects like manga-roulette. Written in Node.js at the moment.

This was added to a seperate repo so it can be reused for other projects later on. Runs using node.js. Supported sites that this can download from:

- [X] Mangadex

  - \* (for the most part)

- [ ] Webtoons

- [ ] Nhentai (nsfw)

- [ ] Pixiv

Other milestones:

- [ ] make pdf's
- [ ] make cbr's
- [ ] add other sites to the roster as well

## requirements:
node.js packages *https* and *fs*. these should come standard for most versions of node.
